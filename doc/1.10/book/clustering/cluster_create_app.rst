================================================================================

For a quick start, skip the details below and jump right away to this detailed
`guide <https://github.com/tarantool/cartridge-cli/blob/master/examples/getting-started-app/README_RUS.md>`_
to creating a cluster-aware Tarantool application.

For going deep into Tarantool Cartridge SDK features, go on with this section.

Install ``catridge-cli``, a command-line tool for developing, deploying, and
managing Tarantool applications:

.. code-block:: console

    you@yourmachine $ tarantoolctl rocks install cartridge-cli

The Cartridge framework will come as a dependency when you create your project.
